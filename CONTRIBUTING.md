# Contributing to CSELPA

Recipe submission guidelines are the same [as for
MELPA](https://github.com/melpa/melpa/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md),
with one difference: unlike for MELPA, adherence to the guidelines is
not a mandatory requirement. However, all deviations from MELPA's
guidelines need to be rationalized.

Non-recipe contributions ought to be submitted to [the upstream
project](https://github.com/melpa/melpa), as this fork tries to follow
upstream in all respects other than package recipes.
